% GAULEG - Gauss-Legendre-Koefficients and Weights
% [x,w] = gauleg(x1,x2,n)
% Given the lower and upper limits of integration x1 and x2 and given n,
% this routine returns arrays x(1..n) and w(1..n) of length n,
% containing the abscissas and weights of the Gauss-Legendre
% n-point quadrature formula.
