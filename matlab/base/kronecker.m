function K = kronecker(A,B)
%KRONECKER   Kronecker tensor product.
%   KRONECKER(X,Y) is the Kronecker tensor product of X and Y.
%   The result is a large matrix formed by taking all possible
%   products between the elements of X and those of Y. For
%   example, if X is 2 by 3, then KRONECKER(X,Y) is
%
%      [ X(1,1)*Y  X(1,2)*Y  X(1,3)*Y
%        X(2,1)*Y  X(2,2)*Y  X(2,3)*Y ]
%
%   If either X or Y is sparse, only nonzero elements are multiplied
%   in the computation, and the result is sparse.
%
%   Class support for inputs X,Y:
%      float: double, single
%
%   NOTE: This function does exactly what Matlab KRON does, but for large
%      full matrices, the engine uses BSXFUN to accelerate the calculation.   
%      Another advantage is no intermediates large matrices is generated
%      (four temporary arrays in case of KRON)
