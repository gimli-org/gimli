3D Darcy flow
-------------

Here we illustrate Darcy flow in a heterogeneous 3D body. We use the general
:py:func:`pygimli.solver.solveFiniteElements` to solve Darcy's law:

.. math::

    \nabla \cdot(K \nabla p)=0

The sought hydraulic velocity distribution can then be calculated as the
gradient field of :math:`\mathbf{v}=-\nabla p`.
