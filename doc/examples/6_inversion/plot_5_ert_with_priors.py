Incorporating prior data into ERT inversion
===========================================
Prior data can often help to overcome ambiguity in the inversion process.
Here we demonstrate the use of direct push (DP) data in an ERT inversion of
data collected at the surface.

# resistive bedrock. We load it from the example repository.

# borehole/direct push with known in-situ-data. We load the three-column
# file using numpy.

# .. note:: Take-away messages
#
#    -  (ERT) data inversion is highly ambiguous, particularly for hidden layers
#    -  prior data can help to improve regularization
#    -  point data improve images, but only locally with smoothness constraints
#    -  geostatistical regularization can extrapolate point data
#    -  incorporation of prior data with geostatistic regularization is best
