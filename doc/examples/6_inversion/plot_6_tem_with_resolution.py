Computing resolution properties
===============================
This example demonstrates how block and smooth TEM modelling is done and how to
access resolution matrices and kernels.

# Next, we define a time vector from 100Âµs to 10ms
# and assume a loop of 100x100m.
# We use the TDEMBlockModelling operator to generate
# synthetic data for a three-layer case and plot it.
# Note that the output is apparent resistivity.
# We could now setup a Marquard-type block inversion
