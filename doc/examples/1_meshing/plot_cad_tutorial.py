CAD to mesh tutorial
====================
In this example you will learn how to create a geometry in 
`FreeCAD <https://www.freecadweb.org/>`_ and then export and mesh it using 
`Gmsh <http://gmsh.info/>`_.
"""

###############################################################################
# Gmsh comes with a build-in CAD engine for defining a geometry, as shown
# in the `flexible mesh generation example <https://www.pygimli.org/_examples_auto/1_meshing/plot_gmsh-example.html#sphx-glr-examples-auto-1-meshing-plot-gmsh-example-py>`_, 
# but using a parametric CAD program such as FreeCAD is much more intuitive and flexible.
#
# For this tutorial you will need Gmsh and its Python API (application
# programming interface). These can be installed by the command below
# inside your (new) conda environment.
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#     conda install -c conda-forge gmsh python-gmsh
#
# If you want to also try out FreeCAD, you can either install it by running
# the command below, or by installing it from their website. These options
# will give you the most up to date versions of FreeCAD.
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#     conda install -c conda-forge freecad
#
# This example is based on an ERT modeling and inversion experiment on a
# small dike. However, this FreeCAD → Gmsh workflow can easily be
# translated to other geophysical methods. The geometry and acquisition
# design come from the IDEA League `master
# thesis <https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A9bf85910-4939-4159-968b-ef558a6ecb7c>`_
# of Joost Gevaert. The target in this example is to find the geometry
# of a sand channel underneath the dike.
#
# FreeCAD: create the geometry
# ----------------------------
#
# Two geometries have to be created. One for modeling and one for
# inversion. When the same meshes are used for modeling and inversion,
# the geometry of the sand channel is alreadyincluded in the structure
# of the mesh. Therefore, the mesh itself would act as prior information
# to the inversion. The modeling geometry consists of three regions: the
# outer region; the inner region (same as inversion region in this
# example) and the sand channel. The inversion geometry consists of two
# regions: the outer region and the inversion region.
#
# The geometries are defined in three steps:
#
# 1. Each region of the geometry designed separately in the Part
#    workbench, or in the Part Design workbench for more complicated
#    geometries. To get familiar with the part design workbench, this
#    `FreeCAD-tutorial <https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Basic_Part_Design_Tutorial_017>`_
#    with some videos is great.
# 2. Merge all regions into one single ”compsolid”, i.e.composite
#    solid. Meaning one object that consists of multiple solids that
#    share the interfaces between the solids.
# 3. Export the geometry in ``.brep`` *
#
# (1) The outer and inversion regions of this dike example were created
# in the Part Design workbench, by making a sketch and then extruding
# it with the Pad option. See the Inversion-Region in the object tree
# in the figure below. You can also have a look at how these geometries
# were created by `downloading <http://pygimli.org/_downloads/cad_tutorial.zip>`_
# the .FCStd FreeCAD files and playing around with them. The sand
# channel is a simple cube, created in the Part workbench. Dimensions:
# L = 8.0 m ; W = 15.0 m ; H = 2.0 m. Position: x = 7.5 m ; y = -1.5 m
# ; z = -2.3 m.
#
# (2) The trick then lies in merging these shapes into a single
# compsolid. This is done in the following steps:
#
# 1. Open a new project and merge all objects, i.e. regions (File →
#    Merge project...) into this project
# 2. In the Part workbench, select all objects and create Boolean
#    Fragments (Part → Split → Boolean Fragments)
# 3. Select the newly created BooleanFragments in the object tree and
#    change its Mode property to CompSolid, see the figure below.
# 4. Keep BooleanFragments selected and then apply a Compound Filter to
#    it (Part → Compound → Compound Filter)
# 5. Quality check the obtained geometry.
#    Select the newly created CompoundFilter from the object tree and
#    click Check Geometry (Part → Check Geometry).
#    SOLID: in the Shape Content, should match the number of objects
#    merged when creating the Boolean Fragments, 3 in this example.
#    COMPSOLID: should be 1. Always, also for other geometries.
#    COMPOUND: should be 0. Always.
#    COMPSOLID: 1 and COMPOUND: 0 indicates that the objects were
#    indeed merged correctly to one single compsolid, see the figure
#    below.
#
# (3) Select the CompounSolid from the object tree and export (File →
# Export...) as .brep.
#
# .. figure:: ../../_static/cad_tutorial/freecad_fig.png
#     :align: center
#
#     FreeCAD important dialogs for making a correct compsolid.
#
# * It must be ``.brep``. This is the native format of the OpenCascade
# CAD engine on which both FreeCAD and Gmsh run. ``.step`` (also
# ``.stp``) is the standardized CAD exchange format, for some reason
# this format does not export the shape as a compound solid. Gmsh can
# also read ``.stl`` and ``.iges`` files. ``.stl`` files only contain
# surface information and cannot easily be reedited. ``.iges`` is an
# old format for which development stopped after 1996 and geometries
# are not always imported correctly.
#
# Gmsh: mesh the geometry
# -----------------------
#
# Meshing with Gmsh is incredibly versatile, but has a very steep
# learning curve. Here we use the Python Application Programming
# Interface (API). To get familiar with the Python API, the Gmsh
# `tutorials <https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/tree/master/tutorial>`_
# (`overview <http://www.cfdyna.com/Home/gmshCatalogue.html>`_) were
# converted to `Python
# scripts <https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/tree/master/tutorial/python>`_
# and additional
# `demos <https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/tree/master/demos/api>`_
# are also provided. I will mention or provide links to relevant
# tutorials and demos, have a look at these for extra context.
#
# Let's start by importing our geometry into Gmsh:


import numpy as np
import pygimli as pg
gmsh = pg.optImport("gmsh", "do this tutorial. Install by running: pip install gmsh")

# Download all nessesary files
geom_filename = pg.getExampleFile("cad/dike_mod.brep")
elec_pos_filename = pg.getExampleFile("cad/elec_pos.csv")
# Starting it up (tutorial t1.py)
gmsh.initialize()
gmsh.option.setNumber("General.Terminal", 1)
gmsh.model.add("dike_mod")
# Load a BREP file (t20.py & demo step_assembly.py)
# .brep files don't contain info about units, so scaling has to be applied
gmsh.option.setNumber("Geometry.OCCScaling", 0.001)
volumes = gmsh.model.occ.importShapes(geom_filename)


###############################################################################
# Before diving into local mesh refinement, putting the electrodes in
# the mesh and assigning region, boundary and electrode markers, the
# .brep geometry file should be checked. Especially check whether the
# meshes of two adjacent regions share nodes on their interfaces. The 
# mesh can be viewed by running the following lines of code:
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#     # Run this code after every change in the mesh to see what changed.
#     gmsh.model.occ.synchronize()
#     gmsh.model.mesh.generate(3)
#     gmsh.fltk.run() 
#
# Tips for viewing the mesh:
#
# 1. Double left clicking opens a menu in where you can set geometry
#    and mesh visibility.
# 2. Tools → Visibility opens a window in which you can select parts of
#    the mesh and geometry. Here you can find the tags of the
#    elementary entities of the geometry. It is also handy later to QC
#    whether physical groups were set correctly.
# 3. Clip the mesh and geometry with Tools → Clipping.
# 4. The number of elements ect. can be found in the Tools → Statistics
#    window.
#
# Make sure to quickly write down the Gmsh volume tags of the outer
# region, dike and channel and the surface tags of the free surface and
# the underground boundary of the box. You will need this in the next
# step.
#
# If importing and meshing the .brep geometry went correctly, great!
# Next we include the electrodes (from Excel file) into the geometry
# and define the Characteristic Length (CL) for each region and the
# electrodes. The CL is defined at each Point and dictates the mesh
# size at that point. The mesh size between points is interpolated
# linearly, by default.


cl_elec = 0.1
cl_dike = 0.6
cl_outer = 30
# Gmsh geometry tags of relevant parts. Find the tags in the Gmsh interface.
tags = {"outer region": 2,
    "dike": 3,
    "channel": 1,
    "surface": [7, 11, 12, 13, 21, 23, 24, 
                25, 27, 29, 30, 31],
    "boundary": [8, 14, 15, 16, 20],      # "Underground Box Boundary"
    "electrodes": []}
# Syncronize CAD representation with the Gmsh model (t1.py)
# Otherwise gmsh.model.get* methods don't work.
gmsh.model.occ.synchronize()
# Set mesh sizes for the dike and outer region.
# The order, in which mesh sizes are set, matters. Big -> Small 
gmsh.model.mesh.setSize(            # Especially t16.py, also t2; 15; 18; 21
    gmsh.model.getBoundary(         # get dimTags of boundary elements of
        (3, tags["outer region"]),  # dimTag: (dim, tag)
        recursive=True),            # recursive -> dimTags of points
    cl_outer)
gmsh.model.mesh.setSize(
    gmsh.model.getBoundary((3, tags["dike"]),recursive=True),
    cl_dike)

# Now reload the script, mesh the geometry again and have a look how
# the mesh changed. The next step is adding the electrodes to the mesh.
# The grid on the dike has 152 electrodes. These points are added in
# Gmsh as points 201-352, to prevent clashing with points already
# defined in the geometry.


# positions: np.array([elec#, x, y, z, y "over ground"])
pos = np.genfromtxt(elec_pos_filename, delimiter=",", skip_header=1)
# Electrodes are put at 2 cm depth, such that they can be embeded in the volume of the dike.
# Embeding the electrodes into the surface elements complicates meshing.
elec_depth = 0.02               # elec depth [m]
pos[:, 3] = pos[:, 3] - elec_depth
# Add the electrodes to the Gmsh model and put the tags into the Dict
for xyz in pos:
    tag = int(200 + xyz[0])
    gmsh.model.occ.addPoint(xyz[1], xyz[2], xyz[3], cl_elec, tag)
    tags["electrodes"].append(tag)
# Embed electrodes in dike volume. (t15.py)

# Reload the Gmsh script and mesh it again to see the result. Further
# mesh refinement is then possible with so-called background fields.
# Taking a quick look at Gmsh tutorial
# `t10.geo <https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/blob/master/tutorial/python/t10.py>`_
# is highly recommended. It shows a wide range of possible background
# fields. In this example a Distance field is defined from the
# electrodes and then a Threshold field is applied as the background
# field:


# LcMax -                         /------------------
#                               /
#                             /
#                           /
# LcMin -o----------------/
#        |                |       |
#      Point           DistMin DistMax
# Field 1: Distance to electrodes
gmsh.model.mesh.field.add("Distance", 1)
gmsh.model.mesh.field.setNumbers(1, "NodesList", tags["electrodes"])
# Field 2: Threshold that dictates the mesh size of the background field
gmsh.model.mesh.field.add("Threshold", 2)
gmsh.model.mesh.field.setNumber(2, "IField", 1)
gmsh.model.mesh.field.setNumber(2, "LcMin", cl_elec)
gmsh.model.mesh.field.setNumber(2, "LcMax", cl_dike)
gmsh.model.mesh.field.setNumber(2, "DistMin", 0.2)

# The final mesh should look something like the figure below. Check
# whether the Physical Groups are defined correctly using the
# Visibility window as shown in the figure. Finally make the inversion
# mesh in the same way as the modeling mesh. The differences being that
# (a) there should be no sand channel in the geometry of the inversion
# mesh. Meaning that there are also only 2 volumes: the outer region
# and the dike, i.e. inversion region. And (b) that the mesh does not
# have to be as fine. cl elec = 0.25 and cl dike = 1.2 were used for
# the inversion mesh in the attached .msh file. Besides changing the
# mesh size by playing around with the CL, the general mesh size can
# also be adapted in Gmsh by changing the Global mesh size factor
# (double left click).
