###############################################################################
# Gmsh comes with a build-in CAD engine for defining a geometry, as shown
# in the `flexible mesh generation example <https://www.pygimli.org/_examples_auto/1_meshing/plot_gmsh-example.html#sphx-glr-examples-auto-1-meshing-plot-gmsh-example-py>`_,
# but using a parametric CAD program such as FreeCAD is much more intuitive and flexible.
#
# For this tutorial you will need Gmsh and its Python API (application
# programming interface). These can be installed by the command below
# inside your (new) conda environment.
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#     conda install -c conda-forge gmsh python-gmsh
#
# In case you also want to try out FreeCAD, installing it from their
# `website <https://www.freecadweb.org/downloads.php>`_ will give you the
# most up to date version.
#
# This example is based on an ERT modelling and inversion experiment on a
# small dike. However, this FreeCAD → Gmsh workflow can easily be
# translated to other geophysical methods. The geometry and acquisition
# design come from the IDEA League `master
# thesis <https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A9bf85910-4939-4159-968b-ef558a6ecb7c>`_
# of Joost Gevaert. The target in this example is to find the geometry
# of a sand channel underneath the dike.
#
# FreeCAD: create the geometry
# ----------------------------
#
# Two geometries have to be created. One for modelling and one for
# inversion. When the same meshes are used for modelling and inversion,
# the geometry of the sand channel is alreadyincluded in the structure
# of the mesh. Therefore, the mesh itself would act as prior information
# to the inversion. The modelling geometry consists of three regions: the
# outer region; the inner region (same as inversion region in this
# example) and the sand channel. The inversion geometry consists of two
# regions: the outer region and the inversion region.
#
# The geometries are defined in three steps:
#
# 1. Each region of the geometry designed separately in the Part
#    workbench, or in the Part Design workbench for more complicated
#    geometries. To get familiar with the part design workbench, this
#    `FreeCAD-tutorial <https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Basic_Part_Design_Tutorial_017>`_
#    with some videos is great.
# 2. Merge all regions into one single ”compsolid”, i.e.composite
#    solid. Meaning one object that consists of multiple solids that
#    share the interfaces between the solids.
# 3. Export the geometry in ``.brep`` *
#
# (1) The outer and inversion regions of this dike example were created
# in the Part Design workbench, by making a sketch and then extruding
# it with the Pad option. See the Inversion-Region in the object tree
# in the figure below. You can also have a look at how these geometries
# were created by `downloading <http://pygimli.org/_downloads/cad_tutorial.zip>`_
# the .FCStd FreeCAD files and playing around with them. The sand
# channel is a simple cube, created in the Part workbench. Dimensions:
# L = 8.0 m ; W = 15.0 m ; H = 2.0 m. Position: x = 7.5 m ; y = -1.5 m
# ; z = -2.3 m.
#
# (2) The trick then lies in merging these shapes into a single
# compsolid. This is done in the following steps:
#
# 1. Open a new project and merge all objects, i.e. regions (File →
#    Merge project...) into this project
# 2. In the Part workbench, select all objects and create Boolean
#    Fragments (Part → Split → Boolean Fragments)
# 3. Select the newly created BooleanFragments in the object tree and
#    change its Mode property to CompSolid, see the figure below.
# 4. Keep BooleanFragments selected and then apply a Compound Filter to
#    it (Part → Compound → Compound Filter)
# 5. Quality check the obtained geometry.
#    Select the newly created CompoundFilter from the object tree and
#    click Check Geometry (Part → Check Geometry).
#    SOLID: in the Shape Content, should match the number of objects
#    merged when creating the Boolean Fragments, 3 in this example.
#    COMPSOLID: should be 1. Always, also for other geometries.
#    COMPOUND: should be 0. Always.
#    COMPSOLID: 1 and COMPOUND: 0 indicates that the objects were
#    indeed merged correctly to one single compsolid, see the figure
#    below.
#
# (3) Select the CompounSolid from the object tree and export (File →
# Export...) as .brep.
#
# .. figure:: ../../_static/cad_tutorial/freecad_fig.png
#     :align: center
#
#     FreeCAD important dialogs for making a correct compsolid.
#
# * It must be ``.brep``. This is the native format of the OpenCascade
# CAD engine on which both FreeCAD and Gmsh run. ``.step`` (also
# ``.stp``) is the standardized CAD exchange format, for some reason
# this format does not export the shape as a compound solid. Gmsh can
# also read ``.stl`` and ``.iges`` files. ``.stl`` files only contain
# surface information and cannot easily be reedited. ``.iges`` is an
# old format for which development stopped after 1996 and geometries
# are not always imported correctly.
#
# Gmsh: mesh the geometry
# -----------------------
#
# Meshing with Gmsh is incredibly versatile, but has a very steep
# learning curve. Here we use the Python Application Programming
# Interface (API). To get familiar with the Python API, the Gmsh
# `tutorials <https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/tree/master/tutorial>`_
# (`overview <http://www.cfdyna.com/Home/gmshCatalogue.html>`_) were
# converted to `Python
# scripts <https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/tree/master/tutorial/python>`_
# and additional
# `demos <https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/tree/master/demos/api>`_
# are also provided. I will mention or provide links to relevant
# tutorials and demos, have a look at these for extra context.
#
# Let's start by importing our geometry into Gmsh:


import numpy as np

import pygimli as pg

gmsh = pg.optImport("gmsh", "do this tutorial. Install by running: pip install gmsh")

# Download all nessesary files
geom_filename = pg.getExampleFile("cad/dike_mod.brep")
elec_pos_filename = pg.getExampleFile("cad/elec_pos.csv")

if gmsh:
    # Starting it up (tutorial t1.py)
    gmsh.initialize()
    gmsh.option.setNumber("General.Terminal", 1)
    gmsh.model.add("dike_mod")
    # Load a BREP file (t20.py & demo step_assembly.py)
    # .brep files don't contain info about units, so scaling has to be applied
    gmsh.option.setNumber("Geometry.OCCScaling", 0.001)
    volumes = gmsh.model.occ.importShapes(geom_filename)


###############################################################################
# Before diving into local mesh refinement, putting the electrodes in
# the mesh and assigning region, boundary and electrode markers, the
# .brep geometry file should be checked. Especially check whether the
# meshes of two adjacent regions share nodes on their interfaces. The
# mesh can be viewed by running the following lines of code:
#
# .. code-block:: python
#
#     # Run this code after every change in the mesh to see what changed.
#     gmsh.model.occ.synchronize()
#     gmsh.model.mesh.generate(3)
#     gmsh.fltk.run()
#
# Tips for viewing the mesh:
#
# 1. Double left clicking opens a menu in where you can set geometry
#    and mesh visibility.
# 2. Tools → Visibility opens a window in which you can select parts of
#    the mesh and geometry. Here you can find the tags of the
#    elementary entities of the geometry. It is also handy later to QC
#    whether physical groups were set correctly.
# 3. Clip the mesh and geometry with Tools → Clipping.
# 4. The number of elements ect. can be found in the Tools → Statistics
#    window.
#
# Make sure to quickly write down the Gmsh volume tags of the outer
# region, dike and channel and the surface tags of the free surface and
# the underground boundary of the box. You will need this in the next
# step.
#
# If importing and meshing the .brep geometry went correctly, great!
# Next we include the electrodes (from Excel file) into the geometry
# and define the Characteristic Length (CL) for each region and the
# electrodes. The CL is defined at each Point and dictates the mesh
# size at that point. The mesh size between points is interpolated
# linearly, by default.


cl_elec = 0.1
cl_dike = 0.6
cl_outer = 30
# Gmsh geometry tags of relevant parts. Find the tags in the Gmsh interface.

    "channel": 1,
    "surface": [7, 11, 12, 13, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31],
    "boundary": [8, 14, 15, 16, 20],  # "Underground Box Boundary"
    "electrodes": [],
}

if gmsh:
    # Syncronize CAD representation with the Gmsh model (t1.py)
    # Otherwise gmsh.model.get* methods don't work.
    gmsh.model.occ.synchronize()
    # Set mesh sizes for the dike and outer region.
    # The order, in which mesh sizes are set, matters. Big -> Small
    gmsh.model.mesh.setSize(  # Especially t16.py, also t2; 15; 18; 21
        gmsh.model.getBoundary(  # get dimTags of boundary elements of
            [(3, tags["outer region"])], recursive=True  # dimTag: (dim, tag)

    )

# defined in the geometry.

# The final mesh should look something like the figure below. Check

# mesh in the same way as the modelling mesh. The differences being that
# (a) there should be no sand channel in the geometry of the inversion
# mesh. Meaning that there are also only 2 volumes: the outer region
# and the dike, i.e. inversion region. And (b) that the mesh does not
# have to be as fine. cl elec = 0.25 and cl dike = 1.2 were used for
# the inversion mesh in the attached .msh file. Besides changing the
# mesh size by playing around with the CL, the general mesh size can
# also be adapted in Gmsh by changing the Global mesh size factor
# (double left click).
