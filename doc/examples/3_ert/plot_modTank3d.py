3D modelling in a closed geometry
=================================

This is a synthetic model of an experimental tank with a highly heterogeneous
resistivity, motivated by the BAM Berlin.

Geometry: 0.99m x 0.5m x 1.0m
Data: 48 Electrodes and 588 Measurements defined in modeltank.shm
Each 24 electrodes are located at two opposite sides of the tank.

We use the pygimli meshtools to create a PLC of the tank and an inhomogeneity.
The needed mesh is created by calling tetgen.

# In contrast to field measurements, experimental tanks have well-defined
# spatial dimensions and need different boundary conditions (BC).
#
# As there is no current flow through the tanks boundary at all, homogeneous
# (Neumann) BC are defined for the whole boundary.
# Neumann BC are natural (intrinsic) for the finite element simulations.
# \link{tutorial:fem:bc}, so we just need to define a cube geometry including
# region markers.

# the marker -99 to the geometry.

###############################################################################
# There are two small problems to overcome for simulating Neumann bodies.
#
# First, we always need dipole current injection since there can be no current
# flow out of the closed boundaries of our experimental tank.
# (Note that by default single poles are simulated and superpositioned.)
# Therefore we define a reference electrode position inside the PLC, with a
# marker -999, somewhere away from the electrodes.

plc.createNode([0.5, 0.5, -0.5], marker=-999)

###############################################################################
# The second problem for pure Neumann domains is the non-uniqueness of
# the partial differential equation (there are only partial derivatives of the
# electric potential so an arbitrary value might be added, i.e. calibrated).
#
# Therefore we add calibration node with marker -1000 where the potential is
# fixed , somewhere on the boundary and far from the electrodes.

plc.createNode([0.75, 0.25, 0.5], marker=-1000)

###############################################################################
# For sufficient numerical accuracy it is generally a good idea to refine the
# mesh in the vicinity of the electrodes positions.
# We force the local mesh refinement by an additional node at 1 mm
# distance in -z-direction.

# First we want to simulate our ERT response for a homogeneous resistivity
# of 1 :math:`\Omega`m. Usually, simulate will calculate apparent resistivities
# (rhoa) and put them into the returned DataContainerERT.
# However, for the calculation of rhoa, geometric factors (k) are expected in
# the data container.
# If simulate does not find any k in the scheme file, it tries to determine
# them itself, either analytically (halfspace) or numerically (topography).
# Note that the automatic numerical calculating can only be a fallback mode.
# You usually want to keep full control about this calculation because you want
# the accuracy as high as possible by providing a special mesh with
# higher quality, lower max cell area, finer local mesh refinement,
# or quadratic base functions (p2).
#
# We don't want the automatic k generation here because we want also to
# demonstrate how you can solve this task yourself.
# The argument 'calcOnly=True' omits the check for valid k factors
# and will add the simulated voltages (u) in the returned DataContainerERT.
# The simulation current (i) is 1 A by default. In addition, the flag
# 'sr=False' omits the singularity removal technique (default) which not
# applicable in absence of (analytic) primary potential.

# The apparent resistivity for a homogeneous model of 1 Ohmm should be 1 Ohmm.
# Therefore we can take the inverse of the modeled resistances for the
# homogeneous model and use it as geometric factors to find the apparent
# resistivities for the inhomogeneous model.

# For such kind of simulations, the homogeneous part should be high accurate
