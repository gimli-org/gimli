Timelapse ERT
=============

Since pyGIMLi we have a class dedicated to timelapse ERT processing & inversion.
The inversion supports different schemes from simple individual over constrained
inversion to fully coupled ("4D") inversion using pyGIMLi's `MultiFrameModelling`
modelling framework.
Additionally, we created a github repository
https://github.com/gimli-org/timelapseERT that holds published data and scripts
demonstrating how to achieve the published results, according to the FAIR data
standards.
This notebook is a simplistic model for a synthetic case.

# We initialize the `TimelapseERT` class by passing the list of data (A).
# Other ways are passing (B) a single data file that either holds all timesteps
# or is accompagnied by another file with the apparent resistivites (optionally
# errors) as matrix, or (C) a file name with a * in it that points to a number
# of data (e.g. `bla*.dat`) to be read sequentially.
#
# Note that in the cases (A) or (C), the data will be homogenized, i.e. brought
# to a single `DataContainerERT` and an apparent resistivity matrix where
# non-existing values are masked out.
# In the initialization, one can pass a list of `datatime` objects to specify
# measuring times. Otherwise they are retrieved from the filenames or just set
# to equidistant intervals.
#

tl = ert.TimelapseERT(DATA)
print(tl)

# %%%
# Masking of data can be achieved by `tl.mask()` specifying minimum and maximum
# apparent resistivity or maximum error.
# Additionally, you can filter the data by `tl.filter()` to set maximum geometric
# factor or remove/select timesteps.
# This command can generate multi-page pdfs of the data.
# tl.generateDataPDF(cMin=30, cMax=100)

# %%%
# One can do a single timestep inversion using `tl.invert(t=i)`. If this
# argument is omitted, are timesteps are inverted sequentially, always using
# the ERT Manager.
# By default, the first model is used as reference, i.e. the model difference
# is constrained. This can be deactivatey by `isReference=False`.
# The reference model can be moved along with the inversion by by `creep=True`
# so that the difference to the preceding step is constrained.
# One can specify regularization options using a `reg` dictionary and, if
# wanted, a different regularization for the timesteps by `regTL`.
#

tl.invert(zWeight=0.3, lam=100)

# %%%
# After inversion, on can show the models by `tl.showAllModels`. For convenience
# (and if many timesteps are involved), one can also generate a multi-page pdf
# by `tl.generateModelPDF`. The user can access the individual models by
# `tl.models[i]` and plot them using `tl.mgr.showResult(tl.models[i])` or
# `pg.show(tl.pd, tl.models[i])`.

# very slight due to its size. Additionally, we see artifacts of increased
# resistivity.
#
# As powerful alternative to a sequential inversion, one can invert all
# timesteps together with constraints along the spatial and temporal
# dimensions. For this there is a special call `fullInversion` that might
# take more memory, but is usually not slower than a sequential inversion
# and moreover more robust.

# %%%
# Here, the results are gone due to the stabilizing smoothness across the time.
# To change the temporal smoothness, one can use the frame scale `scalef`,
# e.g., `tl.fullInversion(scalef=0.5)` for more changes in time.
