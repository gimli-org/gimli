2D crosshole ERT inversion
==========================
In this example, we demonstrate 2D inversion of a crosshole ERT data set
published by Kuras et al. (2009) in the frame of the ALERT project.
For timelapse inversion of the whole data, see TimelapseERT project on github.
We import the used libraries pygimli, meshtools the ERT module and a function
for displaying a data container.
