The DataContainer class
=======================
Data are often organized in a data container storing the individual data values
as well as any description how they were obtained, e.g. the geometry of source
and receivers.

So first a data container holds vectors like in a dictionary, however, all of
them need to have the same length defined by the .size() method.
Assume we want to store Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) data.
