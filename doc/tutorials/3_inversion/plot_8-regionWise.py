Region-wise regularization
==========================

In this tutorial we like to demonstrate how to control the regularization of
subsurface regions individually by using an ERT field case. The data is a 2d
profile that was measured in 2005 on the bottom of a lake. The water body is
of course influencing the fields and needs to be treated accordingly.

We first import pygimli and the modules for ERT and mesh building.

# Data and geometry
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# %%%
# The data was measured across a shallow lake with the most electrodes being on
# the bottom of a lake. We used cables with 2m spaced takeouts.
#

data = pg.getExampleData("ert/lake.ohm")
print(data)

# %%%
# The data consists of 658 data with current and voltage using 48 electrodes.
# We first have a look at the electrode positions measured by a stick.
#

plt.plot(pg.x(data), pg.z(data), "o-")
plt.grid()

# %%%
# On both sides, two electrodes are on shore, but the others are on the bottom
# of a shallow lake with a maximum depth of 2.5m.
#

ax, cb = data.show()

# %%%
# We combined Wenner-Schlumberger (top) and Wenner-beta (bottom) data. The
# lowest resistivities correspond with the water resistivity of 22.5
# :math:`\Omega`m.
#
# The contained errors are measured standard devitations and should not be used
# for inversion. Instead, we estimate new errors using 2% and 100microVolts.
#

# Building a mesh with the water body

#

for i in range(95, plc.nodeCount()):

# boundary, we set its marker >0 by iterating through all boundaries.

# Both look very similar, but let us look at the misfit function in detail.

# %%%
# Apparently, the two regions are already decoupled from each other which
# makes sense. Let us look in detail at the water cells by extracting the
# water body.
# Note. The manager class performs a model value permutation to fit
# the parametric mesh cell. So if you want to relate model values to the input
# mesh, you need to use the unpermutated model values directly from the
# inversion framework instance: `mgr.fw.model``

# Apparently, all values are below the expected 22.5 :math:`\Omega`m

# Moreover, the subsurface structures do not look very “layered”, which is
# why we make the smoothness anisotropic.

# %%%
# As a result of the log-log transform, we have a homogeneous body but
# below the lake bottom values below 20, maybe due to clay content or
# maybe as compensation of limiting the water resistivity too strong. We
# could limit the subsurface, too.
#

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Region coupling
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# In case (does not make sense here) the two regions should be coupled to
# each other, you can set so-called inter-region constraints.

# %%%
# The general image is of course similar, but the structures are mirrored
# around the lake bottom. Moreover the resistivity in the lake is far too
# high. Note that all of the obtained images are equivalent with respect
# to data and errors.
#

# %%%
# Take-away messages
# ------------------
#
# -  always have a look at the data fit and get hands on data errors
# -  a lot of different models are able to fit the data, particularly in
#    the full space
# -  regions can be very specifically controlled
# -  constrain or fix whenever possibly (and reliable)
# -  sometimes geostatistic constraints outperform classical smoothness
#    but sometimes not
# -  play with regularization and keep looking at data fit
