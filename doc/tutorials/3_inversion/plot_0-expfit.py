Simple fit
==========

This tutorial shows how to do the simplest inversion case, a curve fit, by
setting up a custom forward operator. The function to be fitted is`

.. math::

    f(x) = A \cdot e^{-x/X}

with the two unknown coefficients A (a signal  amplitude) and X (a decay rate).
Both A and X are assumed to be positive which is often the case for physical
properties. The easiest way to do this is via a logarithmic transformation of
the model vector (containing A and X) which is very easily done in pyGIMLi.

First we import the pygimli library under a short name pg and the numerics
library numpy. Additionally we load the python plotting module of the library
matplotlib. Both are contained in most python distributions and systems.

###############################################################################
# We set up the modelling operator, i.e. to return :math:`{\bf f}({\bf x})` for
# given model parameters A and X subsumed in a vector. In order to be able to
# use operator in inversion, we derive from the abstract modelling base class.
# The latter holds the main mimic of generating Jacobian and adminstrating the
# model, the regularization and so on. The only function to overwrite is
# **response()**. If no function **createJacobian** is provided, they are
# computed by brute force (forward calculations with altered parameters).


class ExpModelling(pg.Modelling):
    """Exponential decay function modelling operator."""

    def __init__(self, xvec, verbose=False):
        """Initialize with storing x values."""
        super().__init__()
        self.x = xvec

    def response(self, model):
        """Model response, i.e. A*exp(-x/x0)."""
        return model[0] * pg.exp(-self.x / model[1])

        return pg.Vector([1.0, 3.0])


###############################################################################
# The init function saves the x vector and defines the parameterization, i.e.
# two independent parameters (a 1D mesh with 1 cell and 2 properties).
# The response function computes the function using A=model[0] and X=model[1]
# The function startModel defines a meaningful starting vector. There are other
# methods to set the starting model as inv.setModel() but this one is a default
# one for people who use the class and forget about a starting model.

###############################################################################
# We first create an abscissa vector using numpy (note that pygimli also
# provides an exp function and generate synthetic data with two arbitrary A and
# X values.

x = np.arange(0, 1, 1e-2)
data = 10.5 * np.exp(-x / 550e-3)

###############################################################################
# We define an (absolute) error level and add Gaussian noise to the data.

error = 0.5
data += pg.randn(*data.shape) * error

###############################################################################
# Next, an instance of the forward operator is created. We could use it for
# calculating the synthetic data using f.response([10.5, 0.55]) or just
# f([10.5, 0.55]). We create a real-valued (R) inversion passing the forward
# operator, the data. A verbose boolean flag could be added to provide some
# output the inversion, another one prints more and saves files for debugging.

f = ExpModelling(x)
inv = pg.frameworks.MarquardtInversion(f)

###############################################################################
# We create a real-valued logarithmic transformation and apply it to the model.
# Similar could be done for the data which are by default treated linearly.
# We then set the error level that is used for data weighting. It can be a
# float number or a vector of data length. One can also set a relative error.
# Finally, we use an inversion style known as Marquardt scheme (pure local
# damping with decreasing the regularization parameter subsequently) and start
# with a relatively large regularization strength to avoid overshoot.
# Finally run yields the coefficient vector and we plot some statistics.

coeff = inv.run(data, absoluteError=error, verbose=True)
print(inv.relrms(), inv.chi2())

###############################################################################
# We see that after a few iterations the absolute rms value equals the noise
# level corresponding to a chi-squared misfit value of 1 as it should be the
# case for synthetic data. The relative rms (in %) is less relevant here but
# can be for other applications. Additionally the ranges for model and model
# response are given and the objective function consisting of data misfit and
# model roughness times lambda. Note that due to the local regularization the
# second term does not contribute to Phi.

###############################################################################
# We finally create a plotting figure and plot both data and model response.

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, data, "x", x, inv.response, "-")
plt.grid(True)

###############################################################################
# The resulting model vector has a length of 2 and consists of the inverted A
# and X values that are close to the synthetic values, being equivalent within
# error bounds.

print(coeff)

###############################################################################
# If you are interested which way the inversion took, you can have a look at
# the model history.

for model in inv.modelHistory:
    print(model)
