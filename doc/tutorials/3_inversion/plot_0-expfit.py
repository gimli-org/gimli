Simple fit
==========

This tutorial shows how to do the simplest inversion case, a curve fit, by
setting up a known forward operator. The function to be fitted is`

.. math::

    f(x) = A * e^{-x/X}

with the two unknown coefficients A (a signal  amplitude) and X (a decay rate).
Both A and X are assumed to be positive which is often the case for physical
properties. The easiest way to do this is via a logarithmic transformation of
the model vector (containing A and X) which is very easily done in pyGIMLi.

First we import the pygimli library under a short name pg and the numerics
library numpy. Additionally we load the python plotting module of the library
matplotlib. Both are contained in most python distributions and systems.

###############################################################################
# We set up the modelling operator, i.e. to return :math:`{\bf f}({\bf x})` for
# given model parameters A and X subsumed in a vector. In order to be able to
# use operator in inversion, we derive from the abstract modelling base class.
# The latter holds the main mimic of generating Jacobian and adminstrating the
# model, the regularization and so on. The only function to overwrite is
# **response()**. If no function **createJacobian** is provided, they are
# computed by brute force (forward calculations with altered parameters).


class ExpModelling(pg.Modelling):
    def __init__(self, xvec, verbose=False):
        super().__init__()
        self.x = xvec

    def response(self, model):
        return model[0] * pg.exp(-self.x / model[1])

    def createStartModel(self, dataVals):
        return pg.Vector([1.0, 3.0])

###############################################################################
# The init function saves the x vector and defines the parameterization, i.e.
# two independent parameters (a 1D mesh with 1 cell and 2 properties).
# The response function computes the function using A=model[0] and X=model[1]
# The function startModel defines a meaningful starting vector. There are other
# methods to set the starting model as inv.setModel() but this one is a default
# one for people who use the class and forget about a starting model.

# We first create an abscissa vector using numpy (note that pygimli also
# provides an exp function and generate synthetic data with two arbitrary A and
# X values.

x = np.arange(0, 1, 1e-2)
data = 10.5 * np.exp(- x / 550e-3)

###############################################################################
# We define an (absolute) error level and add Gaussian noise to the data.

error = 0.5
data += pg.randn(*data.shape)*error
relError = error / data

###############################################################################
# Next, an instance of the forward operator is created. We could use it for
# calculating the synthetic data using f.response([10.5, 0.55]) or just
# f([10.5, 0.55]). We create a real-valued (R) inversion passing the forward
# operator, the data. A verbose boolean flag could be added to provide some
# output the inversion, another one prints more and saves files for debugging.

f = ExpModelling(x)
inv = pg.Inversion(f)

###############################################################################
# We create a real-valued logarithmic transformation and apply it to the model.
# Similar could be done for the data which are by default treated linearly.
# We then set the error level that is used for data weighting. It can be a
# float number or a vector of data length. One can also set a relative error.
# Finally, we define the inversion style as Marquardt scheme (pure local damping
# with decreasing the regularization parameter subsequently) and start with a
# relatively large regularization strength to avoid overshoot.
# Finally run yields the coefficient vector and we plot some statistics.

tLog = pg.trans.TransLog()
f.modelTrans = tLog
inv._inv.setMarquardtScheme()
inv._inv.setLambda(100)
coeff = inv.run(data, relError, verbose=True)
print(inv.relrms(), inv.chi2())
print(coeff)

###############################################################################
# We see that after 5 iterations the absolute rms value equals the noise level
# corresponding to a chi-squared misfit value of 1 as it should be the case for
# synthetic data. The relative rms (in %) is less relevant here but can be for
# other applications. Additionally the ranges for model and model response are
# given and the objective function consisting of data misfit and model
# roughness times lambda. Note that due to the local regularization the second
# term does not contribute to Phi. Set verbose to True to see the whole course
# of inversion. The values of the coefficient vector (a GIMLi real vector) are
# as expected close (i.e. equivalent) to the synthetic model.

###############################################################################
# We finally create a plotting figure and plot both data and model response.

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, data, 'rx', x, inv.response, 'b-')

###############################################################################
# The createMesh1D automatically attributed the markers 0 and 1 to the two
# model parameters A and X, respectively. Each marker leads to a region that
# can be individually treated, e.g. the starting value, lower or upper bounds,
# or all three at the same time (setParameters). This changes the model
# transformation which can of course be region-specific.

# f.region(0).setLowerBound(0.1)
# f.region(0).setStartModel(3)
# f.region(1).setParameters(0.3, 0.01, 1.0)

###############################################################################
# If these are set before the inversion is used, they are used automatically.
# We set the model by hand using the new starting model

# inv.setVerbose(True)
# inv.setModel(f.createStartModel())
# print(inv.run())
# inv.echoStatus()

###############################################################################
# The result is pretty much the same as before but for stronger equivalence or
# smoothness-constrained regularization prior information might help a lot.
