Geostatistical regularization
-----------------------------

In this example we illustrate the use of geostatistical constraints on
irregular meshes as presented by :cite:`jordi2018geostatistical`, compared to
classical smoothness operators of first or second kind.

The elements of the covariance matrix :math:`\textbf{C}_{\text{M}}` are defined
by the distances H between the model cells i and j into the three directions

.. math::

    \textbf{C}_{\text{M},ij}=\sigma^{2}\exp{\left(
        -3\sqrt{\left(\frac{\textbf{H}^x_{ij}}{I_{x}}\right)^{2}+
                \left(\frac{\textbf{H}^y_{ij}}{I_{y}}\right)^{2}+
                \left(\frac{\textbf{H}^z_{ij}}{I_{z}}\right)^{2}}\right)}.

It defines the correlation between model cells as a function of correlation
lenghts (ranges) :math:`I_x`, :math:`I_y`, and :math:`I_z`. Of course, the
orientation of the coordinate axes is arbitrary and can be chosen by rotation.
Let us illustrate this by a simple mesh:
"""

# %%
# Computing covariance and constraint matrices
# --------------------------------------------
# We create a simple mesh using a box geometry
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import CirclePolygon
from matplotlib.collections import PatchCollection
from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
import numpy as np
import pygimli as pg
import pygimli.meshtools as mt

# We create a rectangular domain and mesh it with small triangles
rect = mt.createRectangle(start=[0, -10], end=[10, 0])
mesh = mt.createMesh(rect, quality=34.5, area=0.1)

# We compute such a covariance matrix by calling
CM = pg.utils.covarianceMatrix(mesh, I=5)  # I taken for both x and y
# We search for the cell where the midpoint (5, -5) is located in
ind = mesh.findCell([5, -5]).id()
# and plot the according column using index access (numpy)
ax, cb = pg.show(mesh, CM[:, ind], cMap="magma_r")

# %%
# According to inverse theory, we use the square root of the covariance matrix
# as single-side regularization matrix C. It is computed by using an eigenvalue
# decomposition
#
# .. math::
#
#     \textbf{C}_\text{M} = \textbf{Q}\textbf{D}\textbf{Q}^{T}
#
# based on LAPACK (numpy.linalg). The inverse square root is defined by
#
# .. math::
#
#     \textbf{C}_\text{M}^{-0.5} = \textbf{Q}\textbf{D}^{-0.5}\textbf{Q}^{T}
#
# In order to avoid a matrix inverse (square root), a special matrix is derived
# doing the decomposition and storing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues values.
# A multiplication is done by multiplying with Q and scaling with the diagonal.
# This matrix is implemented in the :mod:`pygimli.matrix` module
# by the class :py:mod:`pg.matrix.Cm05Matrix`

Cm05 = pg.matrix.Cm05Matrix(CM)
# %%
# However, this matrix does not return a zero vector for a constant vector
out = Cm05 * pg.Vector(mesh.cellCount(), 1.0)
print("min/max value ", min(out), max(out))

# %%
# as desired for a roughness operator. Therefore, an additional matrix called
# :py:mod:`pg.matrix.GeostatisticalConstraintsMatrix`
# was implemented where this spur is corrected for.
# It is, like the correlation matrix, created by a mesh, a list of correlation
# lengths I, a dip angle that distorts the x/y plane and a strike angle
# towards the third direction.
#
C = pg.matrix.GeostatisticConstraintsMatrix(mesh=mesh, I=5)

# %%
# In order to extract a column, we generate a vector with a single 1, multiply
vec = pg.Vector(mesh.cellCount())
vec[ind] = 1.0
cor = C * vec

# %%
# and plot it using a linear or logarithmic scale
kwLin = dict(cMin=-1, cMax=1, cMap="bwr")
ax, cb = pg.show(mesh, cor, **kwLin)
kwLog = dict(cMin=1e-3, cMax=1, cMap="magma_r", logScale=True)
ax, cb = pg.show(mesh, pg.abs(cor), **kwLog)

# %%
# The constraints have a rather small footprint compared to the correlation
# if one considers values below a certain threshold as insignificant.

# %%
# Such a matrix can also be defined for different ranges and dip angles, e.g.
Cdip = pg.matrix.GeostatisticConstraintsMatrix(mesh=mesh, I=[9, 2], dip=-25)
ax, cb = pg.show(mesh, Cdip * vec, **kwLin)
ax, cb = pg.show(mesh, pg.abs(Cdip * vec), **kwLog)

# %%
# Even in the linear scale, but more in the log scale one can see the
# regularization footprint in the shape of an ellipsis.

# %%
# In order to illustrate the role of the constraints, we use a very simple
# mapping forward operator that retrieves the values in the mesh at some given
# positions. The constraints are therefore used as interpolation operators.
# Note that the mapping forward operator can also be used for defining prior
# knowledge if combined with another forward operator in a classical joint
# inversion framework.
# In the initialization, the indices are stored and a mapping matrix is created
# that projects the model vector to the forward response.
# This matrix is also the Jacobian matrix for the inversion.
