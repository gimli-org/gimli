Quality of unstructured meshes
==============================

**Problem:**

    Accurate numerical solutions require high quality meshes. In the case of
    unstructured triangular meshes (or tetrahedral meshes in 3D), relatively
    large and small angles can lead to discretization errors. Large angles can
    cause interpolation errors, while small angles can lead to ill-conditioned
    stiffness matrices.

**Identification:**

    Some common 2D quality measures are
    implemented in :mod:`pygimli.meshtools` and will be used in this tutorial.
    In 3D, we recommend to export the mesh in VTK format and inspect mesh
    quality with ParaView (Filters -> Alphapetical -> Mesh quality).

**Solution:**

    Meshes can be improved by adjusting cell sizes (`area` keyword) and the
    minimum allowed angle (`quality` keyword). :term:`Gmsh` and other more
    advanced meshing tools also provide powerful mesh optimization algorithms.
    However, the numerical accurary may be improved at the expense of increased
    cell counts and thus longer computation times.

# Quality measures
# ----------------
#
# There are numerous measures related to the area/volume, boundary lengths and
# angles of a cell (see [#f1]_ for a review). A straightforward measure
# considers the minimum angle in a triangle (normalized by 60 degrees). More
# sophisticated measures also take into account the cell size. A very common
# measure, often referred to as :math:`\eta`, relates the area of a triangle
# :math:`a` to its edge lengths :math:`l_1,l_2,l_3`.
#
# .. math::
#    \eta = \frac{4\sqrt{3}a}{l_1^2 + l_2^2 + l_3^2}
#
# The normalization factor :math:`4\sqrt{3}` ensures that a perfect triangle
# (equal edges) has a quality of 1. A popular measure also applicable for other
# cell types is the *Normalized shape ratio (NSR)*, which relates the
# circumradius :math:`R` to the inradius of cell (:math:`r`).
#
# .. math::
#    \rho = \frac{2r}{R}
#
# Again the factor 2 (3 in 3D) ensures that a perfect triangle has a quality of
# 1, whereas a flat triangle would have a quality of 0. The above mentioned
# quality measures are plotted below for the same mesh.
