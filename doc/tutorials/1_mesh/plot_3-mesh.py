The mesh class
--------------

The mesh class holds either geometric definitions (piece-wise linear complex -
PLC) or discretizations of the subsurface. It contains of nodes,
boundaries (edges in 2D, faces in 3D) and cells (triangles, quadrangles in 2D,
hexahedra or tetrahedra in 3D) with associated markers and arbitrary data for
nodes or cells.

https://www.pygimli.org/_tutorials_auto/1_basics/plot_2-anatomy_of_a_mesh.html
gives a good overview on the properties of a mesh. Here we demonstrate how to
create and manipulate meshes from the scratch.

import pygimli as pg

# %%%
# We construct a mesh by creating nodes and cells.
#

mesh = pg.Mesh(2)  # 2D

# their properties like node positions,
#

# find all nodes of a given cell or find the neighbors,
#

# We visualize some related property and attribute it the mesh cells.
#

# %%%
# Node-based data are typically shown in form of contour lines.
#
# We can add this (node-based) vector to the mesh as a property.
# The same can be done for cell-based properties.
#

mesh["voltage"] = voltage
mesh["velocity"] = np.arange(mesh.cellCount()) + 2
ax, cb = pg.show(mesh, "velocity")

# %%%
# Cell-based data are, on the other hand, valid for the whole cell, which is
# why they are typically shown by filled patches.
#
# The VTK format can save these properties along with the mesh, point data like
# the voltage under POINT_DATA and cell data like velocity under CELL_DATA.
# It is particularly suited to save inversion results in one file.
# 3D vtk files can be nicely visualized by a number of programs, e.g. Paraview.
